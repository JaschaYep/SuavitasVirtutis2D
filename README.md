# SuavitasVirtutis2D
This is a 2D political RPG that I create to learn Unity Game Design. 
You're an up and coming bureaucrat, making decisions in your ivory tower. You only see the impact of those decisions in your hometown.

You encounter refugees and warlords, mentors and rivals. Some lives you save, some you ruin. If you can make your voice heard, that is.

The main inspirations for my writing are:

    the game "Disco Elysium"
    the short story "Beim Bau der Chinesischen Mauer" by Franz Kafka
    the City Watch novels by Terry Pratchett
    political theory literature on power and bureaucracy, such as "The Price" by Niccolo Machiavelli.

Software used:

    Unity
    Inky
    Aseprite
    Scrivener
    DaVinci Resolve
    Audacity
